# PersonDetails_Hibernate
Person_Details is a Java-based application that leverages the power of Hibernate, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework,
to manage and store person-related information in a database. This project demonstrates the seamless integration of Java and Hibernate to provide
an efficient and scalable solution for storing and retrieving person details.

The Person_Details repository showcases the implementation of a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system that allows users to perform operations on person records.
It serves as an example of how to use Hibernate for data persistence and manipulation in a Java application.

**Key Features**

Hibernate ORM: Utilizes Hibernate to map Java objects to database tables, providing a high-level, object-oriented approach to database interaction.

CRUD Operations: Demonstrates the implementation of basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on person records, highlighting the flexibility and power of Hibernate.
